## 🔭 What I'm Building
### Enigma: A Full-Stack Banking Application (Next.js 14 + AWS)
- **Unified Finance Management**: Connect multiple bank accounts, view real-time transactions, and transfer money.  
- **Collaborative Saving (“Circle Goals”)**:
  - Create shared saving goals with friends or family (e.g., travel, weddings, group gifts).  
  - Lock funds until targets or deadlines are reached.  
  - Track each member’s contributions, progress, and milestones with gamified achievements.  
- **Financial Playbooks**:
  - Step-by-step guides for major life events (buying a home, planning a wedding, starting a family, etc.).  
  - Automated budget suggestions, recommended savings targets, and integrated calculators.  
  - Streamlined referrals to mortgage brokers, insurance agents, and more for convenient financial planning.  

> **Deployment**: Targeting AWS deployment by the end of January.
